The first Docker meetup in Hong Kong was held in the evening on 15th July, 2014. More than 20 Dockers joined the event. The participants shared and discussed Docker as well as other IaaS / PaaS technologies. 

## PaaS trend and Docker

Jimmy Chu of WTF Limited gave an introduction to [Docker](http://www.docker.com) and shared his insights on the trend of PaaS. Jimmy explained that PaaS is trying to solve two big problems: difficulty in handling multiple environments as well as scaling. Also, he presented what Docker is and why Docker is lightweight. Learn more on [his slides](http://goo.gl/wfwAVd).

## DogeOS

Li Yu, the founder of [DogeOS](http://dogeos.net), shared his project to the crowd. Li foresees the need of a pure OS for the cloud, so he developed DogeOS, which is made to be the ultimate cloud OS for datacenters. DogeOS is USB-based, so the entire operating system can be cached in the memory. No more installation is needed. Check out [his slides](http://liyu1981.github.io/slides/2014-07-15-docker-and-cloud-hkmeetup/) to know more about it.

## OpenShift

Last but not least, Radar Lui of Red Hat introduced [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), the open hybrid cloud application platform by Red Hat. Details are in [the slides](http://goo.gl/VW1bX8). Radar revealed also from his talk that OpenShift is gearing up to integrate Docker container to their PaaS offerings. Please do look forward to it!

For those who didn’t get to join us, don’t worry. We currently plan to hold a meetup every 1 or 2 months. For the time being, please visit the [gallery](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Hong-Kong/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=23277782) for the pictures we take during the event.

We look forward to meeting you at the next meetup! ;)
